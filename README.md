### Hi there 👋

I'm a self-taught developer from Germany, who probably drinks too much coffee ☕😅.  
You're likely here because of [Fallout 76 Quick Configuration](https://github.com/FelisDiligens/Fallout76-QuickConfiguration), which is a tool I wrote as a hobby.

I mostly worked with C# 🎵, Python 🐍, and JavaScript ☕📜.
