### Hi there 👋

I'm a self-taught developer from Germany, who probably drinks too much coffee ☕😅.  
You're probably here because of [Fallout 76 Quick Configuration](https://github.com/FelisDiligens/Fallout76-QuickConfiguration), which is a tool I wrote as a little hobby.

I mostly worked with JavaScript ☕📜, C# 🎵, and Python 🐍.
